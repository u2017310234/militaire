# Agent-Based Automated Information Processing and Report Generation Solution
This solution attempts to simulate the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) of human experts through intelligent agents, automating the entire workflow of information acquisition, key point screening, and report generation.

## Core Functionality: Adaptive Intelligent Parsing
The intelligent agent uses tools to obtain overall information from web pages, which is then processed by a large language model (LLM) acting as a "Content Parsing Expert." The LLM intelligently "reads and understands" the page content, accurately identifying and extracting all relevant information as specified by the prompt. After several rounds of operation, a final report is generated. This approach abandons the fragile method of traditional crawlers relying on fixed webpage tags, offering high adaptability to website layout changes and significantly reducing maintenance costs.

## Quality Assurance: Four-Layer Mechanism for Reliable Results
First Layer: Structured Extraction Based on Prompts
For example, in the "Sanctions Compliance Dynamics Weekly Report," carefully designed prompts constrain the model's output, requiring it to identify key fields such as publishing entity, official release date, and news category from the original text, ensuring the accuracy of core facts.
Second Layer: Engineering Fallback Based on Framework
After each model output, the agent uses code to check if the output text contains the required phrases. If not, the process guides the model to reprocess the content. This engineering arrangement serves as a performance fallback for the model.
Third Layer: Professional Summarization Based on Role
After the "Content Parsing Expert" extracts the fields, the model acts as a "Professional News Editor," organizing facts into clear, concise, and professional summaries according to preset logic (e.g., "conclusion first, point-by-point explanation, highlighting impact, output in Chinese").
Fourth Layer: Built-in Source Links for Verification
Each generated summary includes the original news URL at the end. Users can jump to the source for verification at any time, establishing an "AI-efficient processing, human-ready verification" trust loop.

## Deliverable Display: Card-Style Reports at a Glance
Upon completion, the agent generates standardized reports in the following format, which can be directly pushed to the team's database or email. All information is structured and requires no further processing, achieving true "one-step completion" (though manual review is still recommended).

## Innovation Highlights
The core innovation of this project lies in the deep integration and creative application of large language models (LLMs):

Flexible Parsing: The biggest innovation is using LLMs to directly extract the required information links from complex HTML. This goes beyond traditional web crawlers by having AI "read and understand" unstructured web pages, rather than relying on fixed tags, achieving more intelligent and adaptive data extraction. This method is highly robust to website layout changes, significantly reducing maintenance costs.
Flexible Output: By adjusting prompts, the style, format, and information dimensions of summaries can be easily changed without modifying any code logic, giving the system high flexibility.
Strong Controllability: Compared to third-party LLM-based information collection services, this project's code is transparent, relies on internal resources, is easy to modify, and is self-controllable.
Real-Time Display: During execution, a browser can be called to display the current page status in real time. This function can also be turned off to reduce resource consumption.
Autonomous Startup: The script can be set to run automatically at scheduled times (e.g., via Linux cron or Windows Task Scheduler), requiring no manual intervention at startup.
End-to-End (E2E): As shown in the architecture diagram, the process is like a pipeâ€”input goes in one end, output comes out the other, with no manual operation required in between. This allows for unmanned operation (while also allowing manual termination).
Infrastructure Attribute: Can serve as a pre-processing service for extended modules such as stress test scenario generation and public opinion monitoring.
Independent Toolbox: Modular configuration will support MCP protocol. In the future, as infrastructure improves, specific tool modules can be replaced with higher-performing external modules.
